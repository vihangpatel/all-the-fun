      description: ` This is a hands-on workshop for developers in which you will
      learn how to define a common language for collaboration and
      iterate on products faster.
  
      Learn the best practices of component driven design and how to
      standardize your design patterns. Leverage React to build a
      component library that can be used in products and can evolve
      as teams use it. At the end of the day, you will have a small
      but complete Design system implementation that will cover the
      full product lifecycle.`,
