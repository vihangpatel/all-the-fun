        "This is a hands-on workshop for developers in which you will learn how to define a common language for collaboration and iterate on products faster.Learn the best practices of component driven design and how to standardize your design patterns. Leverage React to build a component library that can be used in products and can evolve as teams use it. At the end of the day, you will have a small but complete Design system implementation that will cover the full product lifecycle.",

Changing margins is done by typing, changing font styles is done by typing, and every change often requires you to wait a while before you can see the result.During this talk I want to explore how we can make our development tooling more visually oriented. What can we do to lower the feedback loop and make it easier to create beautiful websites and apps?",

        description:
          "What if it was possible to build backend features for our react apps in the same way that we use redux in our react apps? In this live-coding demo, I will show you how we’ll add backend business logic using the redux abstractions of dispatching actions, writing reducers as pure functions and subscribing to updated state. Our backend will be completely serverless and using open-source and managed services so that we’re not actually deploying and maintaining any servers. We will use GraphQL mutations from our React app to dispatch actions. These will trigger serverless functions which are pure and return the modified state, which will be persisted safely on a cloud managed database. Portions of your app that are subscribed to the state using GraphQL subscriptions (live-queries) will automatically update! You will witness the raw awesomeness of being able to use JavaScript and GraphQL in a pattern that you are comfortable with to build backend features from scratch.",

But open source can also be intimidating to newcomers, and occasionally unwelcoming. In this talk, learn how popular open source framework Gatsby has doubled down on community, including: 1.

In this talk, we are going to cover how to start covering your React app with e2e tests and showcase coolest features that cypress.io has to offer. Automated tests dont have to be boring, difficult to write and even harder to debug. We deserve to have tests we can count on, even when shipping stuff as soon as ASAP.",

React is eating the web.According to its website, React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It’s also an ecosystem of open source tools and development practices. But most importantly, React is a community of people with a firm grip on the steering wheel of web development and where it’s going.Do we know where we are going? When do we know whether we’ve gone too far? Siri, how can we build the best products for our users, while ensuring the continued health of the open web? Siri?Jani is part of the React industrial complex. At his job at Formidable he helps companies and teams build software with JavaScript and React. He advocates the use of React in his conference talks, open source projects, workshops and writing. In this talk full of industry insights, real-world anecdata and many unpopular opinions, he’ll offer his industry insider point of view on where we as a community of developers may have lost the plot, and how we can do better.This is a wake-up call, and the call is coming from inside the house.",
