          description: 'What if it was possible to build backend features for our react apps in the same way that we use redux in our react apps? In this live-coding demo, I will show you how we’ll add backend business logic using the redux abstractions of dispatching actions, writing reducers as pure functions and subscribing to updated state. Our backend will be completely serverless and using open-source and managed services so that we’re not actually deploying and maintaining any servers. We will use GraphQL mutations from our React app to dispatch actions. These will trigger serverless functions which are pure and return the modified state, which will be persisted safely on a cloud managed database. Portions of your app that are subscribed to the state using GraphQL subscriptions (live-queries) will automatically update! You will witness the raw awesomeness of being able to use JavaScript and GraphQL in a pattern that you are comfortable with to build backend features from scratch.',

But open source can also be intimidating to newcomers, and occasionally unwelcoming. In this talk, learn how popular open source framework Gatsby has doubled down on community, including: 1.

          description: 'The almighty React is not just for developers, it\'s for everyone! It leaves no one behind. With React\'s component-driven architecture, UX and web designers can make use of this quality and integrate React in their workflow to bridge the gap between design/prototyping tool and what actually goes on the web in production. This talk explores the topic on how React is not only well suited for designing static components but is well suited for rapid prototyping with interactions.',

          description: 'Why are we afraid of updating our React app on Friday evening? Mostly because its hard to know if nothing is broken because manual testing takes time and automated testing was not reliable. (And we really want to go home). With cypress things are different. In this talk, we are going to cover how to start covering your React app with e2e tests and showcase coolest features that cypress.io has to offer. Automated tests dont have to be boring, difficult to write and even harder to debug. We deserve to have tests we can count on, even when shipping stuff as soon as ASAP.',

          description: 'According to npm, 63% of JavaScript developers use React. This is for a good reason: of all the ways we’ve tried building applications on the web, React seems to have chosen the right tradeoffs to make developers and teams happy and productive. React is eating the web.According to its website, React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It’s also an ecosystem of open source tools and development practices. But most importantly, React is a community of people with a firm grip on the steering wheel of web development and where it’s going.Do we know where we are going? When do we know whether we’ve gone too far? Siri, how can we build the best products for our users, while ensuring the continued health of the open web? Siri?Jani is part of the React industrial complex. At his job at Formidable he helps companies and teams build software with JavaScript and React. He advocates the use of React in his conference talks, open source projects, workshops and writing. In this talk full of industry insights, real-world anecdata and many unpopular opinions, he’ll offer his industry insider point of view on where we as a community of developers may have lost the plot, and how we can do better.This is a wake-up call, and the call is coming from inside the house.',
