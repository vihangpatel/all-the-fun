 *
 * This is useful to us for a couple of reasons:
 *   - It allows us to target the assets for a specific chunk, thereby only
 *     loading the assets we know we will need for a specific request.
 *   - The assets are hashed, and therefore they can't be "manually" added
 *     to the render logic.  Having this method allows us to easily fetch
 *     the respective assets simply by using a chunk name. :)
